# OpenChrom® Community Edition

[OpenChrom®](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenChrom) is a tool for the analysis and visualization of mass spectrometric and chromatographic data developed by [Lablicate GmbH](https://lablicate.com).

It is based on [Chemclipse](https://github.com/eclipse/chemclipse) but offers additional features that cannot be part of the Chemclipse project due to licencing constrains. Those are, most importantly, additional binary data reader as well as the Lablicate marketplace.
